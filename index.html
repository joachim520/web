      <h2 id="first-text">About</h2>
      <p>Our dad is a talented Aerospace Engineer who always worked hard for various aerospace companies all over the world, providing for his family. As he is nearing retiring age, we want to make his dream come true which includes starting up an innovative drone company. The drones will be specialized for various tasks that are focused on doing good for our planet, such as fire fighting and crucial medical transport. The sky is (excuse the pun) the limit.</p><br>
      <p>Elon Musk stated on a recent JRE podcast that "doing airplanes" on top of what he already does, would "make his brain explode" or something in that nature. We are happy to take on responsibility and help our dad to our best capability to make his dreams of innovating the drone industry come true. Any funds are hugely appreciated and will mainly be used during testing and validation of the created technologies and to build prototypes. Most developments made prior to 2020 are all self-funded either by him or by his children. You can expect highly efficient electric drones that are completely autonomous and VTOL capable and efficient in horizontal travel.</p><br>
      Joining him on this mission will be:
      <ul>
        <li>My brother, an embedded software engineer who has helped major companies improve their products since his childhood (yes, he hacked into their code first) and consistently contributes to the open source community</li>
        <li>My cousin, an artificial intelligence engineer who has put his focus on visual artificial intelligence systems and made a high resolution 3D-scanner during his childhood</li>
        <li>Myself, autonomous vehicles engineer, who has focused on electromechanical engineering, heating/cooling, aerodynamics and precise mechanical part design</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>The support means a tremendous amount to our dad and us as a way of showing gratitude towards how he spent all his life selflessly working to get us to where we are in positions and as people in general.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To him, this will mean he finally gets the chance to widely improve the world whilst doing something he absolutely loves (and let me tell you, he is incredibly good at it, think Burt Rutan, but in drones and mostly electric).</p>
      <br>
      <p>A massive Thank-you. Without your amazing support, we really would not stand where we are already. We are very grateful for all the support, no matter what way or how small it feels for you, it means and helps a lot. We will happily invite you once our developments are demonstrated in events.</p>

        <p class="quote"><em>Designing is engineering. Many bigger companies tend to think that they need One expert regarding One task-bundle, but that can create a place that lacks motivation as the employee does the same thing over and over again. Any freshly graduated engineer knows that you can become good at many fields. What big companies forget is that experience is of relative value, an understanding of the physics is much more valuable than sole experience. An employee that understands the physics of nature can be employed on a completely different planet and still be productive because he knows the fundamental nature of the universe and can start building experience from what he knows. Meanwhile, the experienced employee is lost because his correction factors he knows from his experience don't work anymore now that he is out of his comfortable place. It's OK to be educated in a wide variety of fields. You hold the power to become an expert at anything. - To all innovators</em></p>

        <li>Arctos</li>
        <li>Collarus</li>
        <li>Horribilis</li>
        <li>Nelsoni (extinct)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.</p>

              <div itemprop='description'>Hi, my name is Jo. I am a strongly motivated Electromechanical engineer that works for a expedition-truck building company in Belgium. Besides that I am starting up a business inside family bounds that will produce a range of highly efficient drone platforms "VVVV Drones". During university I received an award for my thesis for which I learned working effectively with CAD and make good technical drawings. Always feel free to talk to me, there's a good chance I can help you out with atleast something.</div>
